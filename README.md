# Game of Life

## The Game of life is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.

## The Simulation
    * The simulation is populated with randomly generated cells
    * You can pause and start the simulation
    * You can experiment by clicking to add and remove cells 
    * Read the Wiki artile to understand the significance of this model
 
## The Rules
* For a space that is 'populated':
* Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
* Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
* For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
* Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
